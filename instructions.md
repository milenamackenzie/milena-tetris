# Milena Tetris - Game Instructions

Welcome to **Milena Tetris**, a futuristic twist on the classic Tetris puzzle game!

## Game Mechanics

### Pieces
- 7 different Tetris pieces (I, O, T, J, L, S, Z)
- Each piece has a unique color and shape
- Pieces appear randomly

### Movement
- Pieces automatically fall down over time
- Use controls to position and rotate pieces
- Pieces lock in place when they can't fall further

### Line Clearing
- Complete horizontal rows are cleared
- Clearing multiple lines at once gives bonus points
- The board shifts down after clearing

### Scoring
- **1 line**: 100 points
- **2 lines**: 200 points
- **3 lines**: 300 points
- **4 lines**: 400 points (Tetris!)
- Points are multiplied by current level

### Levels & Speed
- Level increases every 5 lines cleared
- Game speed increases with each level
- Higher levels make pieces fall faster

### Game Over
- Game ends when pieces reach the top of the playfield
- Final score is displayed
- Click "Restart" to play again
